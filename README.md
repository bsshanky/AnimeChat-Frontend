## Iter3:

This is the final iteration of the app. I have build a group chat application where users can talk about their favorite animes. 

### Contribution:

Total contribution as I am the only group member.

### Progress

For this iteration, I have developed most of the UI. In Iteration 2, I worked on the backend. Hence, this iteration was all about completing the remaining UI.

The features that I have covered in this Iteration are:

a. Add message to a group
b. Delete messages only sent out by you
c. Switch bewteen groups
d. Authentication with Google (I moved away from the registration and sign in pages as I was short of time. But I'll try improving this app even after the course ends!)

### Progress

For this iteration, I have developed the login/registration screen of the application.

The Login/Registration page contains:
a. App name
b. App Icon - In this case an Anime character
c. A Login Form
d. A Registration Form

## Iter1:

### Contribution:

As I am the sole member of this group, the entire contribution towards the app's development is mine.

### Progress

For this iteration, I have developed the login/registration screen of the application.

The Login/Registration page contains:
a. App name
b. App Icon - In this case an Anime character
c. A Login Form
d. A Registration Form

To handle the form validation, I have made use of a React 3rd party library called 'Formik'. Using this library has made handling form validation very easy and shortened the amount of code I had to write. 

On the same page the user can switch between the login and registration forms:

Login form:
